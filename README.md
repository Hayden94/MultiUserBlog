![alt front](http://i.imgur.com/YYdou0x.jpg)

This web app features a blog created using the Google App Engine where users have the ability to create their own unique accounts and interact with posts. With these unique accounts, users can create, edit, and delete their own posts. Users can also add, edit, and delete their own comments on any post available. A user may also like any other user's post, but not their own. The account signup, login, and logout features offers security and stability.
